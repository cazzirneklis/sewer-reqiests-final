 <h1> What can sewer complaint requests help us understand about preparing neighborhoods for the effects of climate change?</h1>
 <h3>Sewer overflow is a common danger during storms. The concentration of requests for sewer fixes reveals areas that need infrastructure investment.</h3>

<p> For at least 18 years, residents of 37th street in Sunset Park have seen their block flood in heavy rains because of a broken sewer. Storms this past summer, like Henri and Ida, have magnified this ongoing issue, and despite nearly two decades of requests from residents to fix this issue, answers and help have been hard to find. Their problem is not unique. </p>

<p> Sewer overflow is a common danger when storm flooding meets New York’s outdated combined sewer system, particularly if there is existing sewer damage. Pipes, toilets, and other water fixtures inside homes can spew out dirty water, exacerbating flooding and causing health risks. </p>
 
<p>“Historically we've seen that if the community doesn't take it unto themselves, especially communities of color and disadvantaged communities, no one else will, right. And so if they want to protect themselves from these flood risks, they need to push for their own needs and rights.” Says Victoria Sanders, Research Analyst for the NYC Environmental Justice Alliance (NYC-EJA).</p>

<p> The current recourse for residents who have identified sewer or drainage problems on their street is to submit requests via 311. So: in which community districts do we see a higher proportion of these sewer requests? Where does New York need to shore up its infrastructure most? Staten Island Community Districts 1 and 2, encompassing  Stapleton, Port Richmond, New Springville, and South Beach, and Queens Community District 12, Ozone Park, and Howard Beach have the greatest number of requests per 100,000 residents.  </p>
